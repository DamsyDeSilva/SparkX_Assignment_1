# Introduction

This is a oop exercise to model and implement a cricket game.
Here this is being implemented using JAVA and contains 4 java files.
(Player.java, Team.java, Match.java, CricketGame.java)

### How to run

  Compile & Run
  
    javac CricketGame.java
    java CricketGame
   
  
### Rules of the games are as follows:
  - Two teams, 6 players per team
  - Everyone can ball and bat
  - Runs can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
  - Two ways to get out - caught and bowled
  - Three balls per over, 5 overs per team
  - Batting team is decided by a toss
  - The first team to bat will be batting until all-out or overs finish
  - The winning team will be the one with the highest score of the two

### Minimal requirements:
  - Play the game through the command line
  - Naming the two teams through the command line
  - No need to explicitly name players (hint: naming can be “player 1”, “player 2” ... )
  - Hitting the ball is depicted by “p” key 
  - Runs/ getting out should be random (hint: use a random number generator)
  - After a match, a scoreboard should be shown, with the result
